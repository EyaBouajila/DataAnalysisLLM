## Overview :

This project demonstrates how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for exploratory data analysis using LangChain and Gemini-1.5-Flash. The dataset used is ds_salaries.csv, which contains salary information for data science-related roles.

## Features :
- Querying the dataset using an AI agent powered by Google's Gemini-1.5-Flash.
- Identifying dataset characteristics (number of rows and columns, missing values, categorical distributions).
- Extracting insights such as top-paying jobs, employment types, and seniority levels.
- Visualizing median salaries for senior-level data scientists across different company sizes.
